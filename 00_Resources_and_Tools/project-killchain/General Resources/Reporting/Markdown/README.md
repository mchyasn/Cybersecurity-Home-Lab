# Markdown (A Language for Report Writing/Note Taking)

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is easier to read in its source code form.[9] Markdown is widely used for blogging and instant messaging, and also used elsewhere in online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

Markdown language not only helps in formatting the text files but it saves a lot of time when you are doing report writing. An example would be, you working as a DFIR Analyst, SOC Analyst or VAPT resource and writing a report in MS Word. It's pretty clear it takes a lot of time. Most of the times you will be just throwing in the commands and screenshots while you will be adding the details at the end. This does not happens with markdown lanague. 

Markdown language will enable you to write the details as well as add evidences to your report in one go.

It has proven to be one of the best formatting languages in the field and we personally as well as professionally recommend using it. It allows you to headings, paragraphs, add code snippets, screenshots, hyperlinks and much more. 

Following are few examples, why you should shift onto using the Markdown language. 

1. Imagine adding heading while you are writing a report on MS Word. You have to select the text, and then convert it into heading. But with markdown you can use HTML like syntax to creating heading by using `#` sign i.e. `# (Heading 1)`, `## (Heading 2)` etc.
2. Similarly, adding referenced hyperlinks under the text, you need to select the text and then add the link underneath it. But with markdown, its simple as adding, `[]()`, `[]` -> Text in the Square Brackets, Hyperlink in the `()`  -> Round Brackets
3. Adding image in MS Word is always either copy paste, upload but in Markdown its similar to adding hyperlink, you just need to add exclamation mark before that i.e. `![]()`.
4. Similarly in order to make the text bold just add doubleasterisk as a prefix and postfix i.e. `**PKC**` and to make the text italic just keep single asterisk as a prefix and postfix i.e. `*PKC*`.

Finally, the good thing? *You can export your notes in a PDF format*.
