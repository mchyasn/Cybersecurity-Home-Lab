## Overview

The purpose of this script is to help teams calculate hashes of files as per their daily use and for the incident responders to generate hashes of large number of files all together. 

Generating hashes one by one have a ton of overhead and thus is not recommended. Using `HASHER` enable its users to generate hashes on the fly for the following algorithms. 

1. MD5
2. SHA1
3. SHA256
4. SHA512

The script after calculating the hashes not only displayes it as an output but also saves all the hases in a `CSV` file named `hashes.csv`. The following columns are provided with the CSV results. 

The script saves the following in the CSV file:

1. File Name
2. MD5
3. SHA1
4. SHA256
5. SHA512
