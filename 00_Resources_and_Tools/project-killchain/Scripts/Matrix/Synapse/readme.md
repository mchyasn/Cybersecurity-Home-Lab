## Overview

Managing Synapse can be difficult, with scaling alone accounting for a big chunk of time investment, but these scripts should help you to maintain your Matrix Homeserver. 

These scripts used to support the matrix homeserver from **supreme.sh**, but has since been decommissioned and they are now shared with the commmunity.

## Guidance

Each script has its own readme, so it will provide guidance on how to configure each script to work in your environment. If you need further help or have any issues...

Please, submit any feedback or issues to our **GitHub:** https://github.com/CyDefOps/project-killchain

Thanks.
