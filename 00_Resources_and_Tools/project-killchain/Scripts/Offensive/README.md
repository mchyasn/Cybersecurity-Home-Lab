## Overview

This repository includes scripts which have been part of CyDefOps research or the team has presented on the conferences. 

The scripts are provided for the community to be a quick way of doing their tasks. Some scripts will be specific to the environments/tasks. 

Following are the scripts which are part of this repo. 

1. `BackupsTractor` - Extracting sensitive information from default backups

**Note:** The scripts might need little bit of alteration when you download and plan to use these. We recommend going through the code to understand it for your own learning, modify it as per your requirements and supply the files which are required by the scripts to work properly.
