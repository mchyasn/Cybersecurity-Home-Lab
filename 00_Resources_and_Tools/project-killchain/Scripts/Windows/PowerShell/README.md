## Overview

This repository includes the quick PowerShell scripts which CyDefOps team has created, used, edited or modified during their engagements and from personal usage. 

The scripts are provided for the community to be a quick way of doing their tasks. Some scripts will be specific to the environments/tasks. 

Following are the scripts which are part of this repo. 

1. `Http(s)Test.ps1` - HTTPS Connection Testing
2. `RDPCheck.ps1` - RDP Connection Testing
3. `SMBCheck.ps1` - SMB Connection Testing

**Note:** The scripts might need little bit of alteration when you download and plan to use these. We recommend going through the code to understand it for your own learning, modify it as per your requirements and supply the files which are required by the scripts to work properly.
