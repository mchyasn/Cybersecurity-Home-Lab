## 1. Project KillChain - VAPT Reporting Format
`PKC VAPT Reporting Format` is a `MS Word` document which acts like a boiler-plate for the Vulnerability Assessors, Penetration Testers, Cyber Security Professionals etc. to use it as an initial format and build their report for their projects whether working for an organization or working independently. 

The reporting format also helps to mature the current reporting formats in place and definitely can be updated as you like. We are providing this free for the community as a gesture to giving back to the community and helping the newcomers to understand the importance of good reporting format and how to actually write reports.
