# FloCon - January 13th, 2021 - Workshop: Intrusion Analysis and Threat Hunting with Open Source Tools

Workshop available on YouTube: TBD

## Overview

In todayâ€™s threat landscape, sophisticated adversaries have routinely demonstrated the ability to compromise enterprise networks and remain hidden for extended periods of time. In Intrusion Analysis and Threat Hunting with Open Source Tools, you will learn how to dig deep into network traffic to identify key evidence that a compromise has occurred, learn how to deal with new forms of attack, and develop the skills necessary to proactively search for evidence of new breaches. We will explore key phases of adversary tactics and techniques - from delivery mechanisms to post-infection traffic - to get hands-on analysis experience. Open-source tools such as Suricata and Moloch will be utilized to generate data, perform exhaustive traffic analysis, and develop comprehensive threat hunting strategies. By the end of this workshop, you will have the knowledge and skills necessary to discover new threats in your network.

To help you prepare for this workshop, we recommend that you are familiar with the basics of network security monitoring, IDS/IPS systems and Linux environments. Familiarization with IDS rules is recommended, but not required. We also recommend the following readings:
