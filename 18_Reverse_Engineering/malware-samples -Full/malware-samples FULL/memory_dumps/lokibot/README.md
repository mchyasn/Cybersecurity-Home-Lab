# LokiBot Memory Dumps

These are full VM memory dumps provided during execution with the Cuckoo sandbox (v2.0.7) and include active LokiBot process(es). Configuration files are also included and are the result of running the [MalConfScan](https://github.com/JPCERTCC/MalConfScan-with-Cuckoo) plugin with [Volatility](https://www.volatilityfoundation.org/).  These dumps come from a Windows 7 SP 1 x64 machine. The hash included in the file name is from the sample that was executed.
