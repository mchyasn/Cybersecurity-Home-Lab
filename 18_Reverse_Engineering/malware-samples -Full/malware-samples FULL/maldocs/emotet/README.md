# Emotet Maldoc Samples

This is a collection of Emotet office document samples, to include the associated PCAP from execution. PCAPs may contain the requested Emotet trojan as well as subsequent C2 traffic. Samples are organized by year/month according to the date that I was able to acquire and execute them. Maldcos are named by their MD5, with the corresponding PCAP using the same MD5 hash and a trailing "_ump.pcap".
