# 🧨 Cybersecurity Home Lab — Built from Scratch

This is my personal cyber lab. No bootcamps, no lectures — just bare-metal setups, VMs on fire, logs screaming, and scripts that do damage (or fix it). I built this thing to learn, to test, to break stuff, and to defend it too.

> 💻 Learn by doing. Break by choice. Fix because you understand it.

## 🕸️ What This Is

- Simulated enterprise network
- Custom-built blue/red/purple team ops
- Infrastructure I control top to bottom
- Threats I launch — detections I tune
- Full stack: Windows, Linux, cloud, and hybrid

## 🧠 Why I Built This

Certs? I’ve got some. But this is where I actually **learn**.

This lab runs 24/7. When I break something, I fix it. When I get owned, I analyze the logs. This is where I sharpen my tools and my mindset — and I don’t stop.
