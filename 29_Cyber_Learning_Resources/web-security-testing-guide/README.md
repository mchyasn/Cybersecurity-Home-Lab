# WSTG Page on the OWASP Website

This repository contains the files that build the Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG) Project's page on the main OWASP website. The page can be found at: https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/

Documentation explaining the files in this repo can be found at: https://owasp.org/migration

## Contributions

Any contributions to the guide itself should be made via the [guide's project repo](https://github.com/OWASP/wstg), using a pull request. (No one outside the project leadership or foundation automation should be pushing directly to either repo.)

> [!CAUTION]
> Contributions should only be made in the proper repo against the latest content. Please don't open PRs here for versioned or stable content, they represent point-in-time state.
