# Module 9 Challenge

## Overview
In this challenge assignment, I played the role of a Network Jedi working for the Resistance. The task was to restore the Resistance's core DNS infrastructure and verify the routing of traffic after a DoS attack by the Sith Empire. The assignment involved reviewing network issues, documenting DNS record types, identifying the reasons for network issues, and providing recommended fixes. Additionally, the assignment included tasks related to wireless decryption using Aircrack-ng and analyzing encrypted wireless internet traffic using Wireshark.

## Grade and Feedback
"Hello, Lodoe!

Congratulations on a good homework assignment!  You've demonstrated troubleshooting skills for evaluating DNS infrastructure issues, finding an efficient network route, and performing reconnaissance on captured network traffic!

You’ve successfully leveraged nslookup to query the existing DNS records for mail exchangers in Mission 1, Sender Policy Framework in Mission 2, Canonical Name in Mission 3, and authoritative name servers in Mission 4. 

You’ve accurately explained the DNS-related issues regarding email delivery in Mission 1, spam filtering in Mission 2, and domain name aliasing in Mission 3. 

Now, in Missions 1, 2, 3, and 4, you've recommended corrective action to restore service to the Resistance.  

Since the network traffic from the planet of Batuu to the planet of Jedha is very slow, you were asked to determine a more efficient route according to the Open Shortest Path First protocol.  You were unable to document a short path so that the Resistance can develop a static route to improve traffic.

For mission 6, you successfully cracked the wireless key, and you were able to decrypt the ARP traffic to determine your target’s IP and MAC addresses!

Finally, you successfully accessed the Star Wars ASCII animation!

You’ve done a great job documenting your ability to perform basic TCP/IP network administration and network reconnaissance.  Keep up the good work!

## Reflection
This assignment provided an exciting opportunity to apply my knowledge and skills in DNS, network routing, wireless security, and packet analysis. I gained hands-on experience in using nslookup to identify DNS records, analyzing network maps to determine optimal routes, decrypting wireless traffic using Aircrack-ng, and analyzing decrypted packets in Wireshark. The feedback I received will help me further enhance my understanding of network infrastructure and strengthen my ability to troubleshoot and secure networks. I am thrilled to have contributed to the Resistance's efforts in saving the galaxy!
