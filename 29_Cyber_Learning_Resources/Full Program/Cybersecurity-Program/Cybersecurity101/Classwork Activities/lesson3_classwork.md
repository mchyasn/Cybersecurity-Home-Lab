# Lesson 3: Classwork

Today, we focused on exploring cybersecurity careers and preparing for the Security+ exam.

## Activity File: Cybersecurity Careers Research

In this activity, I searched popular job websites like Indeed, LinkedIn, and Dice for cybersecurity jobs. I reviewed at least three job postings in depth and at least two job postings with similar titles to note the differences in required skills and qualifications.

I used various search terms that aligned with my interests, such as "cybersecurity analyst," "information security," and "cybersecurity engineer." While I already had a good idea of the specific roles I was interested in, I hope to get a better sense as the program progresses.

I found a diverse range of job descriptions that included technical and non-technical responsibilities. The skills and qualifications that I frequently saw were a strong understanding of cybersecurity concepts, knowledge of security tools and technologies, and experience in risk management and threat analysis. I noticed that the skills and qualifications differed between jobs with similar titles, indicating the importance of reading job descriptions thoroughly.

## Activity File: Security+ Sample Questions

In this activity, we answered sample questions that we can expect to find on the Security+ exam. These questions appear in Domain 1, Module 3 of the exam: Explain threat actor types and attributes.

We worked through seven questions that covered topics such as threat actor groups, insider threats, and hacktivists. These questions challenged me to think critically and apply my understanding of cybersecurity concepts.

Overall, today's classwork provided valuable insights into the cybersecurity job market and helped me prepare for the Security+ exam.
