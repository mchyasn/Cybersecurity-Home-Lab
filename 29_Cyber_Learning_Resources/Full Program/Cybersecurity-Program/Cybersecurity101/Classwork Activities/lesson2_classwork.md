# Lesson 2: Classwork

## Activity 1: The Stolen iPhone

In this activity, we were tasked to determine several malicious methods that an attacker could do with a stolen iPhone. Some of the ways malicious actors could use the stolen phone include:

Accessing sensitive data such as emails, contacts, and photos

Planting malware or spyware to monitor activities on the phone

Using the phone to commit identity theft by accessing sensitive accounts such as banking or social media accounts

Using the phone to launch social engineering attacks such as phishing or pretexting

Selling the phone on the black market to someone who may use it for malicious purposes

## Activity 2: Attacking the Wall

In this activity, we were hired to solve a critical problem faced by a startup, Bitcoin Dating Exchange, whose login process was totally insecure. We brainstormed and came up with 15 ways that a malicious actor could penetrate the system and login as a user or administrator. Some of the attack strategies we identified include:

Password guessing or cracking

Brute-force attacks

Social engineering attacks such as phishing

Injection attacks

Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks

Man-in-the-middle attacks

## Activity 3: Defending the Wall

In this activity, we proposed mitigation strategies to defend against the attacks that we identified in the previous activity. Some of the mitigation strategies we suggested include:

Implementing multi-factor authentication

Enforcing password policies such as length, complexity, and expiration

Limiting login attempts and implementing lockout policies

Encrypting sensitive data in transit and at rest

Using firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems

Regularly updating and patching software and systems


As a beginner, these activities helped me understand the different ways that attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in systems and the importance of implementing effective defense strategies to protect against these attacks.
