# Classwork

## Overview
In Lesson 1 of Module 4, we began exploring the Linux operating system, a key component in many technical cybersecurity roles. In this lesson, we learned how to navigate the Linux file structure using the command line, manage processes with various commands, and install packages using `apt`.

## Key Takeaways
- There are many distributions of Linux available, and it's important to choose the appropriate one for your use case.
- Navigating the Linux file structure using the command line is an essential skill for IT and cybersecurity professionals.
- Managing processes with commands like `top`, `ps`, and `kill` is critical for monitoring and controlling system performance.
- Installing packages using `apt` is an important part of maintaining a Linux system.

## Today's Activities

- Distribution Research: Conducted research to determine which Linux distribution is most appropriate for each machine.
- Linux Landmarks: Explored the Linux file system using the command line.
- Process Investigation: Investigated all the processes running on a Linux file system to determine if there are any obvious processes that should not be running.

## Reflection

Lesson 1 provided a solid introduction to the Linux operating system and its fundamental components. Learning how to navigate the file system using the command line and manage processes were particularly valuable skills that will be useful in future cybersecurity tasks. The activities provided ample opportunities for hands-on practice and helped reinforce the material covered in class. Overall, this lesson was an excellent foundation for future lessons on Linux system administration.
