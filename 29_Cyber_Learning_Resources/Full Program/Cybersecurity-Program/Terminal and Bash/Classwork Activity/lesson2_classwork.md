## Overview

In Lesson 2 of Module 3, we focused on expanding our command-line skills and learning about new commands such as man, find, grep, and wc. We also learned how to use pipes to combine multiple commands to accomplish intermediate IT tasks.

## Key Takeaways

- The man command can be used to list instructions and options for each command.

- The find command can locate files based on search parameters.

- The grep command can search within the contents of files.

- The wc command can count words and lines.

- Pipes can be used to combine multiple commands in sequence to accomplish intermediate IT tasks.

Today's activities included practicing using familiar and new commands, using man pages to learn how to run new commands and options, using find command syntax to search for files and directories, using grep command syntax to search for data points inside of files, and practicing all of the commands learned so far to complete a security-related task.

## Reflection

Lesson 2 provided a deeper understanding of the terminal and command-line commands. Learning about the man, find, grep, and wc commands was especially helpful in increasing my proficiency in navigating and searching through files. The activities throughout the day allowed for hands-on practice, which solidified my understanding of the material. Overall, this lesson was informative and engaging, and I look forward to applying these skills in future cybersecurity tasks.
