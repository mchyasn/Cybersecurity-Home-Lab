"Hello Lodoe, Great job on this assignment! You've demonstrated excellent skills in archive and log management systems. Your ability to create, extract, compress, and manage tar backup archives was impressive. You successfully implemented the necessary commands to extract the Tardocs, create a Javaless archive, and ensure that Java/ was not included in the new archive. Your work on automating tasks with cron jobs and writing basic bash scripts was also commendable. Overall, this has been an amazing start to understanding how to manage logs and research, and apply new features. Keep up the good work! AD"
