# Module 11 Challenge

## Overview
In the Module 11 Challenge, I tackled various topics related to network security. The challenge consisted of review questions, a hands-on lab on configuring firewalls, and additional questions about IDS, IPS, defense in depth, and firewall architectures. I also had the option to complete an additional challenge lab on spam detection and analysis.

## Review Questions
In the review questions section, I covered topics such as security control types, intrusion detection and attack indicators, and the cyber kill chain. I provided explanations for different security control types, the differences between IDS and IPS, and the stages of the cyber kill chain.

## "Drop Zone" Lab
In the lab exercise, I assumed the role of a junior security administrator at Drop Zone, an indoor skydiving company. The task was to configure firewalls according to specific requirements and add blacklisted IPs to the drop zone. I followed the instructions provided and successfully completed the lab.

## IDS, IPS, DiD, and Firewalls
This section involved answering questions about IDS, IPS, defense in depth, and firewall architectures. I defined IDS and IPS, described their connections to a network, and identified the types of IDS based on their detection approaches. I also matched scenarios to the appropriate layers of defense in depth and provided methods of protecting data-at-rest and data-in-transit. Additionally, I explained different firewall types based on their functionalities.

## Optional Additional Challenge Lab: "Green Eggs & SPAM"
I had the option to complete an additional challenge lab that involved investigating and analyzing indicators of attack related to spam. Unfortunately, I do not have access to the specific details and cannot provide a summary of the lab.
