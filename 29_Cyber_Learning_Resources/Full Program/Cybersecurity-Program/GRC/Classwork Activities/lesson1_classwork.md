# Lesson 1 Classwork Activities

In Module 2, we explored fundamental cybersecurity concepts and strategies for mitigating threats. We also practiced applying the Security Culture Framework to real-world scenarios.

## Activity 1: Assessing Threats

We worked in groups to evaluate the potential threats posed by various technologies. We identified several potential threats related to a USB drive scenario, including malware or virus infection, data theft, and network intrusion. We also brainstormed defense strategies, such as using antivirus software and providing employee training.

## Activity 2: CIA Triad and Security Scenarios

We analyzed security scenarios and identified which element of the CIA triad each situation was concerned with. By analyzing these scenarios, we were able to better understand the CIA triad and how it applies to real-world security situations.

## Activity 3: Security Culture Framework - Part 1

We played the role of a security consultant hired to help a local bank develop a plan to address a physical security issue that resulted in the breach of its financial data servers. We applied the first step of the security culture framework by measuring and setting goals, identifying security risks and potential solutions.

## Activity 4: Implementing Security Controls

We drafted recommendations for GeldCorp to immediately reduce employee tailgating through physical, technical, or procedural controls. We identified three different controls and answered questions about how they would reduce tailgating, the cost of implementation, and the expected percentage reduction in tailgating rates.

Overall, these activities helped us develop a deeper understanding of fundamental cybersecurity concepts and how to apply them to real-world situations.
