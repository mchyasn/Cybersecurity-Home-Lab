## Assessing Threats

In this activity, we worked in groups to evaluate the potential threats posed by various technologies. We considered the scenario of finding a USB drive on the ground and discussed the following questions:

How is a USB drive able to execute running code when plugged into a computer?

Why can't our computer stop the drive from running?

How might we defend against USBs like this?

We had a productive discussion and identified several potential threats related to this scenario, including:

Malware or virus infection

Data theft or exfiltration

Network intrusion or disruption

We also brainstormed several defense strategies, including:

Using antivirus software to scan USB drives before plugging them in

Implementing strict access control policies to limit who can connect USB drives to company computers

Providing employee training on how to identify and handle suspicious USB drives

## CIA Triad and Security Scenarios

In this activity, we analyzed security scenarios and identified which element of the CIA triad (confidentiality, availability, or integrity) each situation was concerned with. We discussed the following scenarios:

A hospital only allows authorized healthcare personnel within one department to access patient Personal Identifiable Information. When employees move to another department, they lose access.

Confidentiality

A technology firm maintains an alternate site that is running at all times. Operations can be moved to this location in the event of a major disaster.

Availability

Employees need key cards in order to enter their company offices.

Confidentiality

A company hashes their data files to monitor whether information has been tampered with.

Integrity

Only authorized personnel at a company have write access to certain files. All other employees have only read access to these files.

Confidentiality

A company employs redundant servers, which means that systems are duplicated. In the event of a malfunction, one server will step in for the other.

Availability

A company's network infrastructure uses load balancers, which distribute the "load" of tasks, such as file requests and data routing, to a variety of servers. This ensures that no single device is overburdened.

Availability

A cybercriminal uses a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept wireless traffic from users.

Confidentiality

A cybercriminal cracks a hashed message and changes its contents.

Integrity

A cybercriminal launches a DDoS attack that floods a website with unwanted traffic from multiple computers and takes the site offline.

Availability

By analyzing these scenarios, we were able to better understand the CIA triad and how it applies to real-world security situations.
