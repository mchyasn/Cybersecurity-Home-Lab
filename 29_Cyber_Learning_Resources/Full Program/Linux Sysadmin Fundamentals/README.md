# Module 4 Homework Assignment: Linux System Administration
## Overview
In this homework assignment, we acted as a system administrator to troubleshoot a malfunctioning Linux server. The senior administrator was pleased with our work and has now tasked us with preparing another server to replace the malfunctioning one. The steps involved in this process include ensuring permissions on sensitive files, creating user accounts, creating a user group and collaborative folder, and running system and security auditing tools to harden the system.

## Feedback 
"Hello, Lodoe

Well done on an outstanding homework assignment! This challenge has been a great opportunity for you to demonstrate the knowledge you have learned over the past few weeks and demonstrate your Linux system administration skills. With this submission, you have done an outstanding job to demonstrate your system administrator skills.

On that note, you did an excellent job with checking the permissions of the four requested files and set allof the permissions accordingly as outlined:

/etc/shadow permissions should be set to allow only root read and write access

/etc/gshadow permissions should be set to allow only root read and write access

/etc/group permissions should be set to allow root read and write access and everyone else only read access

/etc/passwd permissions should be set to allow root read and write access and everyone else only read access

Next, you did great work creating the user accounts listed and demonstrated all five commands to do so. You also successfully created the requested engineerâ€™s group, added the respective users to the group and created a shared folder! Great work!

Lastly, Lodoe, you did excellent work with your Lynis audit. You demonstrated excellently, the process to install lynis, view the manual/help page of lynis and successfully run a lynis audit. Further you provided a screen shot supporting the evidence of suggestions to be taken on the system - well done!

 Lodoe, you have done excellent on this deliverable. You even went beyond and completed the bonus for chkrootkit! - well done

Keep up the great work, this is an awesome start to your boot camp!

Cheers!
