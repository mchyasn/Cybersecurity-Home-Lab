{
  "question": "What is the primary requirement for an Random Bit Generator's (RBG) output to be used for generating cryptographic keys?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "The RBG's output should have a length that matches the target data to be protected",
    "B": "The RBG's output should be computationally indistinguishable from random bits and provide sufficient entropy to support the security strength required for the target data",
    "C": "The RBG's output should be as long as possible to ensure maximal randomness",
    "D": "The RBG's output should have precisely the same length as the symmetric key to be generated"
  },
  "solution": "B"

  "question": "In cryptography, what is the purpose of using a key-derivation function (KDF)?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "Generate public keys",
    "B": "Authenticate digital signatures",
    "C": "Encrypt data using a password",
    "D": "KDF are algorithms used to transform a secret into crucial parameters like keys and Initialization Vectors (IVs)"
