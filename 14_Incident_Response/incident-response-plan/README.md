## DESCRIPTION

### Prologue

#### Taxonomy ####

![](images/gsvsoc-irplan.taxonomy.png)


##### Cybersecurity #####

The words cybersecurity and security are synonymous and used interchangeably herein.

Cybersecurity is the state of being protected against the violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices, or the measures taken to achieve this.

##### Asset #####

The words asset, information asset, information technology resource, and other processing activities are synonymous and used interchangeably herein.

##### Event #####

An event is an observable occurrence in a digital ecosystem or computer network. Event examples include a login, a user connecting to a file share, a server receiving a request for a web page, a user sending email, and a firewall blocking a connection attempt.

##### Alert #####

The words alert and alarm are synonymous and used interchangeably herein.

An alert is an event having a security context usually generated from threat detection assets or treat hunting routines. Alerts may be the result of a negative consequence and generally require subsequent inspection. Examples of alerts include system crashes, unauthorized use of system privileges, unauthorized access to sensitive data, execution of malware, and destruction of data.

##### Incident #####
The word incident and the term event of critical interest are synonymous and used interchangeably herein.

An incident is an event or alert that signifies a security control failure, or a violation, or imminent threat of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices that require critical triage and a more in-depth investigation known as **incident response**.

During disciplined cybersecurity operations, including investigating and analyzing alerts, it is common for information security professionals to label the resulting analysis in terms of risk of compromise. An incident, or event of critical interest, is an analysis that results in a declaration of **real or imminent danger and significant risk of asset compromise** or confirmation thereof. 

As an example, take two classes of typical cybersecurity events: *potentially unwanted program* and *ransomware*. The latter, ransomware, represents an event of critical interest because its progression through the environment represents real and imminent danger and could result in a significant risk of compromise to critical assets. 

Another example may be an individual receiving a *phishing email* and realizing that it has attached malware, is in of itself NOT an incident (detective controls worked). However, an individual downloading that attached malware IS possibly an incident (preventative or corrective controls did not work) dependent on subsequent control failures (defense-in-depth failures) or **real or imminent danger and significant risk of asset compromise** or confirmation thereof.

An analogy in the natural world might be the comparison of a misdemeanor *vehicular moving violation* to a felony *armed robbery*. The latter, armed robbery, would be considered an incident.

----

1. Preparation
2. Identification
3. Containment
4. Eradication
5. Recovery
6. Lessons / Opportunities For Improvement


Implementers of this IRP use an **OODA** loop as guidance for conducting COA:

1. Observe

3. Decide
4. Act


#### Preparation

##### Roles

1. ISO
    1. The Information Security Office or Officer(s) or designated representative(s) shall be responsible for ensuring the *strategic* effectiveness of this IRP.
2. CSIRT
    1. The Computer Security Incident Response Team or designated representative(s) shall be responsible for ensuring the *tactical* effectiveness of this IRP.

##### Risk Management

The ISO shall be responsible for establishing risk management strategies that meet or exceed a standard of reasonable cybersecurity practices. These activities protect information assets, controls, and processes against a violation of the organization’s computer security policies or acceptable use policies. The ISO is responsible for establishing controls and processes aligned with the five (5) core functions of Cybersecurity Risk Management as defined by the [NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework).

1. Identify
2. Protect
3. Detect
4. Respond
5. Recover

##### Cybersecurity Technology Controls

The CSIRT shall routinely conduct inspections of the cybersecurity technology controls (cyber weapon assets) used to detect and or prevent incidents to ensure cyberweapon readiness. The CSIRT shall own the responsibility of remediating defects, disruptions, or degradation of cyber weaponry assets and security controls. The ISO shall routinely request from the CSIRT a report of the state of cyber weaponry assets and security controls readiness. The CSIRT shall promptly comply with an ISO request for a report of the state of cyber weaponry assets, and security controls readiness and maintain the provided report for no less than one (1) year.

##### Severity Ratings

This IRP uses the priority levels defined in the US National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) Cyber Incident Scoring System (CISS) as the model for rating the severity of
an Information Security Incident. SEE [NCCIC CISS Severity Rating Model](https://www.us-cert.gov/NCCIC-Cyber-Incident-Scoring-System)

Severity rating levels shall be used to determine the necessary force and resource prioritization required to handle and respond to an incident. The CSIRT is responsible for declaring the initial severity rating. The ISO is responsible confirming and adjusting security ratings that meet or exceed a High rating.

##### Tactics, Techniques & Procedures

The CSIRT and ISO shall use qualified Information Security Personnel, and cyber weapons, and security controls capable of defending and preventing adversaries from using specific tactics, techniques, and procedures as described by the [MITRE ATT&CK Framework](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/).

SEE the **NOTES** section for TTP examples including **Protecting Against Ransomware** and **Protecting Against Phishing**

##### Log Retention

The ISO shall be responsible for ensuring that log data transmitted by assets is properly preserved, protected, and maintained for a period of one (1) year.

##### Alert Response & Threat Hunting

The CSIRT shall respond to alerts generated by cyber weapons and security controls. The CSIRT shall routinely patrol (threat hunt) and audit log data and assets for indicators of compromise.

##### Evidence Collection & Preservation

The CSIRT shall establish an electronic/virtual evidence locker to store and protect evidence collected during incident response. The CSIRT should maintain an electronic journal (manifest) of collection activities and their related evidence artifacts. The CSIRT shall maintain an electronic chain of custody ledger that includes the date, the evidence artifact, the transferrer, and the transferee for all activities involving the transfer of collected artifacts from the evidence locker to authorized recipients or electronic media. The ISO shall approve all transfers of evidence artifacts to authorized recipients or electronic media.

The ISO shall maintain and protect evidence locker artifacts collected during an Information Security Incident for one (1) year from the date of the initial detection. The ISO shall maintain and protect the Information Security Incident after-action incident report and any related communications for one (1) year from the date of the initial detection.

##### Restoring Operations

The ISO shall certify that assets impacted by a successful compromise are eligible for being restored to their normal operational state only after remediation activities have prevented the assets from further risk of intrusion.

##### After-Action Report

The CSIRT shall produce an after-action report that provides the details of the incident. The CSIRT should produce content for the report iteratively during the response. The ISO shall approve all dissemination of the report.

SEE [Mission Model Report](https://github.com/guardsight/gsvsoc_mission-model)

##### Coordination, Sharing &amp; Notifications
###### Internal

The ISO shall be responsible for coordinating and sharing details of an incident to internal authorized Personnel, without undue delay on a need to know basis, when the ISO deems that sharing is beneficial to response activities and per the organization's data classification policies.

###### Individuals, Customers & Data Subject Notifications (EU GDPR 34)

The ISO shall be responsible for coordinating and delivering notifications, without undue delay, to individuals, customers, and data subjects for the purposes of complying with statutes, regulations, or ordinances if the ISO determines the incident is likely to result in an infringement of, or high risk to, the rights and freedoms of those individuals, customers, and data subjects that have been impacted by the compromised assets.

###### Controller &amp; Supervisory Authority Notifications (EU GDPR 33)

The ISO shall be responsible for coordinating and delivering notifications, within seventy two (72) hours of identifying an incident, to the supervisory authority (when organization is acting as a controller) or the controller (when organization is acting as a processor) for the purposes of compliance with the EU GDPR regulation if the ISO determines the incident is likely to result in an infringement of, or high risk to, the rights and freedoms of those individuals, customers, and data subjects that have been impacted by the compromised assets and/or information technology resources.

###### US State Authority Notifications

The ISO shall be responsible for coordinating and delivering notifications, without undue delay, to various state authorities (SEE [here](https://www.bakerlaw.com/files/Uploads/Documents/Data%20Breach%20documents/Data_Breach_Charts.pdf) and [here](http://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/security-breach-notification-laws.aspx)) for the purposes of complying with statutes, regulation, or ordinances if the ISO determines the Information Security Incident is likely to result in an infringement of, or high risk to, the rights and freedoms of those individuals, customers, and data subjects that have been impacted by the compromised assets and/or information technology resources.

###### Law Enforcement

The ISO shall be responsible for notifying law enforcement to comply with statutes, regulation, or ordinances or threat actor prosecution if the ISO determines the incident meets the standard of a condition identified through discussions with law enforcement representatives provided such discussions have previously taken place. The ISO shall refrain from contacting multiple agencies when reporting an incident to avoid jurisdictional conflicts. The following is a list of law enforcement agencies:

1. Federal Bureau of Investigation
2. U.S. Secret Service
3. District Attorney
4. State Attorney General

###### Media

2. Become Familiar With Breach Notification Laws
   1. [Security Breach Notification Laws](http://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/security-breach-notification-laws.aspx)


----

#### Identification

##### Assess & Rate
1. Breathe
2. Think "smooth is fast"
3. Inspect change logs to determine if activity is possibly the result of an authorized change
4. Review system baselines to determine if activity is possibly the result of expected behavior
5. Ask asset owners what they know in terms of Indicators Of Compromise (IOC) and record the results
    1. SEE Top Indicators of Compromise (TOP-IOC) below for hints
    2. SEE [MITRE ATT&CK Framework](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/) for hints
6. Ask asset owners **"Was there a loss of data?"** and record the results
7. Ask asset owners **"Was restricted data at risk?"** and record the results
8. Assign a severity rating
    1. SEE [NCCIC CISS Severity Rating Model](https://www.us-cert.gov/NCCIC-Cyber-Incident-Scoring-System)

##### Memorialize & Share

**IMPORTANT - When possible encrypt communication - threat actors may be listening to the channel**


1. Make notes of actions you took during the assessment phase
   1. What you do, see, and hear will be used by investigators, after-action reporting, and maintained for posterity purposes
2. Record times
3. Communicate using 24HR/military time (e.g. 0900, 1330, 1845)
4. Record atomic attributes
4. Record behavioral attributes
5. Make factual assertions backed by evidence
6. Peer review observations and assertions with experienced personnel
7. Mark email communication with "CONFIDENTIAL//ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE//TLP:AMBER" labels
8. Use encryption or an alternative band of communication if the material is extremely sensitive

##### Collect

**IMPORTANT - Keep a system POWERED ON prior to the collection of volatile media to preserve valuable evidence**
<br />(isolate the host by disconnecting its network connection or through the use of EDR)


1. Journal collection activities 
2. Conduct log analysis
3. Conduct system forensics
    1. Use a DFIR checklist
    2. Acquire volatile media
    3. Acquire non-volatile media

##### Store

1. Follow a consistent evidence process that achieves the objective of provenance
2. Journal evidence activities
3. Establish an evidence locker
4. Preserve evidence

----

#### Contain

**CONTAINMENT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT COA DURING INCIDENT RESPONSE**


1. Create a list of COA based on the nature of the threat
2. Use the OODA loop method as guidance for COA
3. Organize the COA by using the mnemonic: **Inventory + 6-Ds**
    1. Inventory
    2. Detect
    3. Deny
    4. Disrupt
    5. Degrade
    6. Deceive
    7. Destroy
4. Force rank COA based on strategies that:
    1. Mitigate risk
    2. Create an advantage for the responders
    3. Preserve evidence
    4. Consider collateral damage
    5. Align with policies
    6. Respect the law
5. Use the properly maintained cyber weapons to fortify the **Inventory + 6-Ds**
6. Apply defensive and offensive force concentration tactics
    1. *NOTE: Force concentration does not guarantee relief from a flank of routine threat activity: **watch the wire!**
    2. *NOTE: Force concentration is useless if containment assets are idle: **assign COA & put weapons to use**
7. Manage fatigue to avoid defective decision making and maintain consistent pressure on the adversary
8. Avoid decision avoidance, solve the problem, embrace the challenge, and be fast-acting
9. Get in the fight and regain control of the impacted assets!

----

#### Eradicate / Remediate

1. Inspect the asset to ensure the threat has been fully eradicated
2. Remediate all known vulnerabilities
3. Apply controls to prevent further intrusion

----

#### Recover / Restore

**IMPORTANT - Restore only after remediation activities have prevented the assets from further risk of intrusion**


1. Restore to a normal state 
    1. Recovery point objective (RPO)
    2. Recovery time objective (RTO)

----

#### Lessons / Opportunities For Improvement (OFI)

1. Develop OFI as gaps are discovered during the response
2. Record the OFI in the after-action report

#### After-Action Report

SEE [Mission Model Report](https://github.com/guardsight/gsvsoc_mission-model)

1. Develop content for the report in an iterative manner as response activities are being conducted
2. Supply detailed and factual statements and artifacts
    1. Summary
    2. Timelines (attack & response sequences)
    3. Indicators of Compromise (IOC) (the nouns of the attack)
    3. Intrusion Kill Chain (IKC) (threat actors activity - bad guy verbs)
    4. Courses of Action (COA) (reponders activity - good guy verbs)
    5. Opportunities for Improvement (OFI) (lessons learned)
3. Disseminate the report
