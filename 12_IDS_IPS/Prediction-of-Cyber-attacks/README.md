# Prediction-of-Cyber-attacks
Prediction of Cyber-attacks (IDS/IPS) using Machine Learning

The results of this project show that creating a prediction model with machine learning methods
can improve accuracy and offer early network attack detection. According to the results, applying
machine learning techniques can decrease human error in the diagnostic procedure, increasing
the model's efficacy. The research successfully predicted network attacks and significant assaults
using AI-based methodologies, yielding acceptable accuracy, recall, and F1 Score. These
findings highlight the potential advantages of applying the suggested AI calculation technique to
the field of network security.
