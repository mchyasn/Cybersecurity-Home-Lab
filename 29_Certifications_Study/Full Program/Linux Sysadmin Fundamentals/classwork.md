# Classwork

## Overview

In this module, we gained technical hands-on experience by using bash and the command line. We began with basic file navigation and retrieval, expanded into file searching and combining commands, and concluded with text processing and editing to develop a custom command-line script.

## Key Takeaways

- The command line is an essential tool for IT and cybersecurity professionals.
- Navigating and searching files, combining commands, and text processing are all fundamental skills in using the command line.
- Practice and persistence are necessary to master command-line skills.

## Reflection

Module 4 was a valuable learning experience, as we were introduced to Linux operating systems and the basics of IT system administration. We learned about foundational concepts such as users, groups, permissions, and access controls. The hands-on practice with our web lab helped us become more comfortable with Linux and its functionality, and we now understand the importance of mastering Linux sysadmin fundamentals for many technical cybersecurity roles.

Looking forward to next week's activities, we will build on our Linux sysadmin knowledge by learning how to archive and restore data using Linux tools. We will also learn how to schedule data backups and monitor log files to prevent and detect suspicious activity.
