# Lesson 2 Classwork

## Risk Management and Threat Modeling

## Overview

In today's class, we learned about cyber risk management and threat modeling. We applied the OWASP threat modeling process to a fictional company called GeldCorp and developed a risk mitigation plan.

## Key Takeaways

- Threat modeling involves identifying threat agents, possible attacks, and exploitable vulnerabilities relevant to a given asset.

- Risk analysis involves prioritizing risks based on likelihood and impact potential and choosing and justifying controls for a given risk.

- A risk template spreadsheet can be used to generate a risk matrix and heat map.

- Risk mitigation plans involve conceptualizing solutions to reduce the likelihood or impact of identified risks.

## Activities

Threat Modeling Steps 1–4: We applied steps 1–4 of the OWASP threat modeling process to GeldCorp's business operations and assets. This involved identifying key assets, identifying trust boundaries, defining potential abuse cases, and identifying relevant threat agents, attacks, and vulnerabilities.

Threat Modeling Step 5: Risk Analysis: We filled out a risk template spreadsheet and generated a risk matrix and heat map for GeldCorp. This allowed us to prioritize risks based on likelihood and impact potential.

Threat Modeling Step 6: Mitigating Risk: We conceptualized a risk mitigation plan for GeldCorp. This involved developing solutions to reduce the likelihood or impact of identified risks, such as implementing access controls, updating software, and conducting employee training.

## Reflection

Threat modeling and risk management are essential components of cybersecurity. Learning how to identify and prioritize risks, as well as develop solutions to mitigate them, will be crucial in my future work as a cybersecurity professional. Overall, this lesson was informative and provided valuable practical skills.
