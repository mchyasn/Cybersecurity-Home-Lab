# Module 12 Challenge

## Overview
In the Module 12 Challenge, we covered various topics related to web development. Here is a summary of the key points:

- The HTTP request and response process occurs in a client-server architecture. The parts of an HTTP request include the request line, request headers, and request body (which is optional). The three parts of an HTTP response are the status line, response headers, and response body.

- Status codes in the 4xx class represent errors. The most common request methods encountered by security professionals are GET and POST. POST is used to send data, and the request body contains the data being sent.

- Curl is a powerful tool for making HTTP requests from the command line. It offers advantages over the browser, such as automation and scripting capabilities, the ability to set request headers and options, and direct access to response data. Curl options like `--request` and `--header` can change the request method and set request headers, respectively.

- Sessions and cookies are used to recognize and distinguish clients in HTTP servers. The response header `Set-Cookie` sends a cookie to the client, and the request header `Cookie` continues the client's session.

This is just a summary, and the full report can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12caGhWsY4snEYg8GYGH9R7pVWxVE5W822YuJtW4MvF4/edit?usp=sharing).

## Feedback 
"Hey, Lodoe

You’ve done amazingly with this assignment! It is important for Cybersecurity professionals to know how to manage cookies with CLI tools. Using the power of curl you were able to:


•	Log into WordPress and save the user's cookies to a cookie jar
•	Test a WordPress page by using a cookie from the cookie jar
•	Pipe the output from the cookie through grep to check for authenticated page access.
•	Attempt to access a privileged WordPress admin page.

Fantastic job here! Just have a look at:

Q20- the login details
Q24-be specific
Q27

Keep up the good work and this smooth flow you've established!
