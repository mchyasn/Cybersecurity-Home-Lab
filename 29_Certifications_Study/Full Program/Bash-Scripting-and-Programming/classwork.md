# Classwork for Module 6: Bash Scripting and Programming
# Overview
In the concluding module of our introduction to Linux system administration, we delved deeper into bash scripting and programming, which are pivotal skills in any Linux environment. By combining commands, creating custom commands, and writing bash scripts, we were able to execute complex tasks including the collection of logs, auditing, reconfiguring a Linux machine, and initial steps towards system hardening.

# Key Takeaways
Combining commands and creating custom commands significantly streamline the process of executing tasks in a Linux environment.
Bash scripting allows for more intricate and automated tasks, increasing efficiency and reducing potential for error.
Understanding and implementing system hardening steps is crucial in enhancing system security and resilience against potential threats.
The "Linux scavenger hunt" provided a practical application of our accumulated skills and tools, reinforcing our grasp of Linux system administration.

# Reflection
The final module presented the opportunity to synthesize and apply the skills we've been building throughout the course. The hands-on nature of the tasks and challenges, such as the Linux scavenger hunt, greatly enriched our understanding of how to manage and secure Linux systems. As we set up our Azure Lab account in preparation for transitioning to the Windows environment, we look forward to carrying the principles and practices we've learned into the next stage of our studies. Furthermore, playing the role of a hacker in the upcoming assignment promises to enhance our understanding of system vulnerabilities, informing our ability to build more robust defenses.
