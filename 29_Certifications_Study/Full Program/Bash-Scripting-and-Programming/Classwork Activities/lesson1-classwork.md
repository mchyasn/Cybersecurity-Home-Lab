# Overview
In today's lesson, we dove deeper into the power of the Linux command line by combining commands, creating custom commands, and initiating our journey into bash scripting. Over the next two lessons, these skills will be instrumental as we engage in tasks such as evidence collection, auditing and reconfiguring a Linux machine, and initiating system hardening processes.

# Key Takeaways
Learning to construct compound commands using operators like &&, |, and file redirects increases efficiency and offers more control over command-line operations.
Creating and saving alias commands to the ~/.bashrc file allows for customization of the command line, further enhancing efficiency.
Adjusting $PATH variables to include a custom ~/scripts directory expands the accessibility of custom scripts across the file system.
Bash scripts, which are essentially lists of commands, can automate repetitive tasks and streamline system operations.

# Today's Activities
- Compound Commands Exercise: In an effort to automate the process of auditing a new system, we combined several commands to create more comprehensive, yet fewer, overall commands.
- Creating Aliases: We created custom commands using aliases and stored them in the ~/.bashrc file, making them permanently available for future sessions.
- My First Bash Script: We ventured into scripting, where we put a list of commands into a script file and ran our first basic script using ./ notation.
- Custom Commands: To further enhance command line usability, we transformed our script into a custom command, then added a script directory to the $PATH. This allows for direct calling of the script on the command line from any directory.

# Reflection
Today's lesson was a deep dive into the powerful capabilities of the Linux command line. The ability to combine commands, create custom commands, and begin writing bash scripts are crucial skills for managing and securing Linux systems. The activities were hands-on, which provided a practical understanding of the concepts discussed in class. These foundational skills will be invaluable in the coming lessons when we begin to audit, reconfigure, and harden Linux systems. Overall, a very informative and engaging lesson.
