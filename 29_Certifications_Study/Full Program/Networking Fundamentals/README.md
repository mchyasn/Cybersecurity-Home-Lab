# Module 8 Challenge

## Overview
In this challenge assignment, I played the role of a network security analyst for RockStar Corporation. The task was to complete a network vulnerability assessment of their new office in Hollywood, California. The assessment involved four phases, which included tasks such as pinging network assets, running SYN scans, analyzing PCAP files, and identifying network vulnerabilities and potential hacker activities.

## Grade and Feedback
"Hello Lodoe, 
Thank you for turning in your homework this week! You did a great job demonstrating the skills you have learned during class! 
You were incredibly thorough in your answers. You got to get hands on experience using fping, thinking in OSI layers, and coming up with mitigation suggestions. 
You were also able to get the correct packet and fish out the message! More hands on solo work with Wireshark! Incredible! 
Keep up the great work into the future!"

## Reflection
This assignment allowed me to apply my knowledge and skills in network security assessment. I gained hands-on experience in subnetting, CIDR, IP addresses, ping, SYN scans, PCAP analysis, DNS, HTTP, ARP, and TCP. Through this assessment, I learned how to identify network vulnerabilities and potential hacker activities, as well as recommend mitigation strategies. The feedback I received will help me further improve my network security analysis skills and reinforce my understanding of the OSI model and its layers. I am excited to continue developing my expertise in network security in future assignments and real-world scenarios.
