### Feedback:

You've demonstrated your cyber culture framework, nice submission. Good job indicating the potential security risks within the company organization. You were also able to provide your preferred security behaviors for risk mitigation, as well as provide quantifiable metrics for assessing these behaviors and outcomes. Finally, you were able to identify desired goals and outcomes based on your security measures and precautions. Good work identifying five employees or departments that can be involved in the plans for projected security measures. You were able to also describe their respective roles and responsibilities as it applies to training and best practices. We are impressed to see you cohesively present your training structure and overview. Your plans indicate the frequency and format of execution, and they include a description of specific topics covered in training and an explanation of how efficacy of training will be measured. You have done a really good job and taken a great amount of time on Module 2. Here are a few things to consider as you move on through the bootcamp: Think of these Modules as something that you can put in a professional portfolio. Many times these will be a student's first documents in a Cyber Portfolio. Proofreading, material sourcing, and later for your exploits and such; SCREENSHOTS. Stay organized, make a folder perhaps for every evening of class and take many many snips along the way. Nice work!
