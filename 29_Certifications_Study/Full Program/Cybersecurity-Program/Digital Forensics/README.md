# Digital Forensics

## Scenario
You will continue working with your group to finalize the case report that you began in class. You will work with your team to fill out the report. You will submit the final report as your Challenge deliverable for this week. 

## Lab Environment
This Challenge will use the Digital Forensics - Autopsy lab in Kali Linux. You will find the tracy-phone-2012-07-15.final.E01 file located in the /corpus directory in Autopsy.

## Instructions
You've examined and documented quite a bit of information from the iPhone image file. Now you will use that documentation to build a final report.

First, fill out the following evidence worksheet to document the case's WiFi and GPS locations. You will add this, along with the Correspondence Worksheet, to the final report.

- Location Information Worksheet

Your group can search for WiFi and GPS info in the following directories:

- Find information about WiFi locations in root/Library/Caches/locationd/consolidated.db.
- Find information related to WiFi and cell tower location information in consolidated.db.

Working in your group's copy of the report template, add content and details as indicated in each section.

You will rely on the Locations Information and Correspondence Evidence Worksheets that you've completed so far. Additionally, you can use the iPhone Forensics - Important Files and Databases resource to find and analyze more information that supports your case, such as voicemails or notes from the Notepad iPhone application.

Be sure to add to the report a list of the equipment and tools that you used to gather and analyze the evidence.

For example: Autopsy, the operating system (Kali Linux), text editors (Nano), etc.
When including pictures from the iPhone, use the time stamp of the Created time from Autopsy.

# Feedback 
"Hello Lodoe, I commend your continuous efforts on your assignment. You made some solid improvements judging from the previous feedback, and your Appendix B section seems to be strengthened. That being said, the feedback regarding your plot timeline still sands. It is relatively short with not events being reported beyond a day. The conclusion is also rather short as well. Your efforts are still commended though. Keep pushing for excellence and be sure to finish strong. Best of luck to you." -RO
