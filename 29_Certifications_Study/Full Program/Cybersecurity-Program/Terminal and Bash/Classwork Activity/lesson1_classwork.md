## Reflection

Today's class was a great introduction to the terminal and bash commands. The activities we completed provided hands-on experience and practice with common command line commands. As a beginner, I found it challenging to remember all the commands and their syntax, but with practice, I'm confident I'll be able to navigate and manipulate files more efficiently using the command line. Overall, I'm excited to continue learning and developing my skills in this area.
