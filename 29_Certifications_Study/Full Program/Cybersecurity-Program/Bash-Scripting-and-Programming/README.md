# Module 6 Homework Assignment: Advanced Bash and Owning the System
# Overview
In this assignment, I assumed the role of a system administrator, as well as a simulated attacker for the purpose of understanding system vulnerabilities and defenses. In my tasks, I delved into the complexities of Linux system structures, user and group permissions, cron job scheduling, and log analysis. I also developed bash scripts and explored advanced features of the shell to automate common tasks.

# Grade and Feedback
"Hello Lodoe! Congratulations on an outstanding homework assignment! You’ve demonstrated your hacking skills, remotely accessed a victim’s machine, maintained access via a backdoor and cracked sensitive passwords! And then you successfully shadowed your victim and you’ve executed the commands to create a secret system user with administrative privileges! Nice use of John The Ripper as well. Keep crushing it! -AD"

# Reflection
As the final assignment for this module, the experience was incredibly immersive and instructive. By taking on both the roles of system administrator and simulated attacker, I gained a multi-faceted understanding of Linux systems, vulnerabilities, and defenses. This hands-on approach to learning about system vulnerabilities, backdoors, and password cracking tools like John The Ripper was an invaluable part of my journey towards becoming a cybersecurity professional. I look forward to applying these skills and knowledge to real-world scenarios in my career.
