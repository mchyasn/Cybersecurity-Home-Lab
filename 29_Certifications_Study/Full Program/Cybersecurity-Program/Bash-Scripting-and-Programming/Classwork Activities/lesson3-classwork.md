# Overview
In today's lesson, we continued building upon our bash scripting knowledge, eventually culminating in a Capture the Flag activity that tested the totality of our acquired skills. As a significant step towards a hands-on understanding of practical cybersecurity, we tackled this Linux scavenger hunt. Finally, we signed up and registered for Azure Lab Services, which will be crucial for our forthcoming module on Windows.

# Key Takeaways
Learning to connect to a server using ssh is a fundamental skill for managing and accessing remote systems.
By participating in the Capture the Flag Linux scavenger hunt, we utilized the skills and tools we've learned in the past three modules.
Capture the Flag activities are practical applications of theoretical knowledge, providing valuable insight into how to navigate and resolve real-world cybersecurity scenarios.

# Today's Activities
Capture the Flag Scavenger Hunt: We employed our accumulated knowledge from previous modules to search for "flags" on a Linux system. This activity emphasized teamwork and the practical application of our learning.
Azure Lab Services Registration: We signed up and registered for Azure Lab Services to prepare for the upcoming Windows module.

# Reflection
Today's class marked an exciting culmination of our Linux and bash scripting studies. The Capture the Flag activity was a challenging yet engaging opportunity to test and apply our skills in a real-world-like scenario. Registering for Azure Lab Services was an exciting step towards the forthcoming module on Windows. Overall, through researching, problem-solving, and applying our skills, we have greatly advanced our understanding of Linux system administration and scripting. As we transition to the Windows module, we look forward to leveraging our Linux skills and learning new ones in a different operating system context.
