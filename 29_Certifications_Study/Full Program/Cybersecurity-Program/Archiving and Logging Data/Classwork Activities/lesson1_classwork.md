# Classwork
## Overview
In Lesson 1 of Module 5, we continued exploring Linux system administration, focusing on how to use Linux tools to archive data, schedule data backups, and monitor log files. In this lesson, we learned how to use the tar utility for data backup and recovery, ensuring data integrity and availability by archiving users' data and system configuration files.

## Key Takeaways

- Archiving data is crucial for ensuring its availability in case of a natural disaster or cyberattack.
- Scheduling data backups to be made hourly, daily, or monthly is an important aspect of system administration.
- Monitoring log files helps prevent and detect suspicious activity, keeping systems running efficiently.
- The tar utility is a versatile tool for creating, listing, and extracting archives in Linux systems.

## Today's Activities
Creating and Restoring Backups with tar: In this activity, we created a full backup of a directory and its files, including file permissions, owner, size of file,     and date and time information. We verified the archive after saving the output to a text file, and then located the correct archive to restore the needed directory     and files.

Exploiting tar: In this exercise, we ran a tar exploitation and researched how to harden systems against this exploit.

## Reflection
Lesson 1 of Module 5 provided an excellent opportunity to learn about data backup and recovery using the tar utility in Linux systems. Gaining hands-on experience with creating, listing, and extracting archives allowed us to better understand the importance of archiving data and the role it plays in system administration. The activities were engaging and reinforced the key concepts covered in class. Overall, this lesson built on our existing Linux knowledge and introduced valuable skills for maintaining data integrity and availability.
