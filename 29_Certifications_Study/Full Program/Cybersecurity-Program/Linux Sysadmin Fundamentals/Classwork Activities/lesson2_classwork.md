# Classwork
## Overview
In Lesson 2 of Module 4, we continued our introduction to Linux by covering one of the operating system's most important functions: access control. We learned about password strength, careful control of the sudo command, and file permissions.

## Key Takeaways
- john can be used to audit passwords.

- The sudo and su commands can be used to elevate privileges.

- Users and groups can be created and managed to control access.

## Today's activities included:
- Using john to crack password hashes
- Using sudo and su to log in as different users and check their sudo privileges
- Editing the sudoers file  
- Managing users and groups to ensure least privilege.

## Reflection
Lesson 2 provided a comprehensive overview of Linux access controls, including password auditing, privilege elevation, and user and group management. The activities throughout the day allowed for hands-on practice, which solidified my understanding of the material. I feel more confident in my ability to use these tools and techniques to secure Linux systems and networks.
