# Penetration Test Report

## Overview
In the Penetration Test Report challenge, I documented the activities undertaken during two weeks of penetration testing against MegaCorpOne. The objective was to create a comprehensive report for the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) of MegaCorpOne, detailing the findings and results of the penetration testing engagement. The report served as the final deliverable for the challenge and required thorough documentation of the testing methodology, vulnerabilities discovered, executive summary, vulnerability overview, and MITRE ATT&CK Navigator mapping.

## Reflection
This challenge provided an opportunity to demonstrate my ability to effectively communicate and present the findings of a penetration testing engagement. The report allowed me to showcase my understanding of the testing methodology, identification and documentation of vulnerabilities, and mapping of techniques to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. It also emphasized the importance of clear and concise reporting to convey the impact and significance of the identified vulnerabilities to non-technical stakeholders. Overall, the challenge enhanced my skills in creating professional and informative penetration test reports.
