## Grade and Feedback
I received a grade of 94 on this assignment, with the following feedback:

"Hello, Lodoe!

You’ve done a good job locating and describing the global threats facing corporations and consumers today. You’ve described many types of attacks, Cybersecurity concepts, and consequences of malicious activity.

However, you’ve answered with the correct response and grabbed an opportunity to describe 14 of 15 in 1st part; you should revisit the ransomware family details for the 1st, where you missed answer correctly.

Lodoe, you’ve finished Part 2: Akamai; you’ve been able to look up practically all of the answers and articulate them clearly. Good learning curve by answering correctly for 10 out of 10!

Now, Lodoe; Except 3rd, where you missed to answer correct percentage; you’ve done a good job on Part 3: Verizon Data Breaches Investigation! All 6 out of 7 articulated correctly.

Congratulations on a good homework assignment! You’ve demonstrated your knowledge of recent Cybersecurity statistics! Lodoe, keep up the good work, and we will help you grow into a Cybersecurity Professional before you know it."
