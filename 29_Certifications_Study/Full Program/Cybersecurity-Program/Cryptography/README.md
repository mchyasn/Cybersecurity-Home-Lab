# Module 10 Challenge

## Overview
In this challenge assignment, I played the role of a cybersecurity analyst at Nakatomi Hospital. The hospital's patient records were encrypted by ransomware, and I had to solve six cryptographic riddles to decrypt the data. The riddles involved various cryptographic concepts such as Caesar Cipher, encoding and decoding, binary, symmetric and asymmetric encryption, key distribution, hashing, hashcat, steganography, and more.
