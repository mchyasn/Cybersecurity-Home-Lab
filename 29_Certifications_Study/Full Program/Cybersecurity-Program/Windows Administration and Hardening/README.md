# Module 7 Homework Assignment: A Day in the Life of a Windows Sysadmin

## Overview
In this challenge assignment, I played the role of a Windows sysadmin and performed various tasks related to Group Policy Objects (GPOs) and PowerShell. I created GPOs to mitigate vulnerabilities, implemented an account lockout policy, enabled PowerShell logging and transcription, and created a PowerShell script to enumerate Access Control Lists (ACLs).

## Grade and Feedback
"Hello,  Lodoe!

you have done an excellent job on this assignment, this has been a great opportunity for you to demonstrate your knowledge around Windows Administration, Powershell and Active Directory skills.

On that note, you have done very well with the required Group Policy tasks. Specifically, you created a policy titled; NO LLMNR, Account Lockout and “Powershell Logging”. 

Further, you have done a great job on assigning Account Lockout values for lockout duration lockout threshold and lockout count; all of which were assigned reasonable values following Microsoft’s Guidance on Account Lockout Policy. 

Additionally, you enabled all the correct settings for the individual policies that make up “Powershell Logging”, allowing you to enable many auditing/logging features.

  

Also,  Lodoe, you have done quite well with your Powershell script. You have successfully created yourself a for-each-loop that allowed you to enumerate the ACL (Access Control List) of files within a folder, for the current directory the script is being ran from. As you can see, scripting – whether Bash or Powershell is a strong skill for any administrator to automate tasks on a system.
  
Cheers to an excellent assignment,  Lodoe and keep up the great work!

## Reflection
This assignment allowed me to dive deeper into the responsibilities of a Windows sysadmin. By creating GPOs and configuring security policies, I learned how to mitigate vulnerabilities and enhance the security of Windows systems. Additionally, working with PowerShell enabled me to automate tasks and gain insights into the access control of files and directories through ACL enumeration. The feedback I received will guide me in refining my skills and further exploring the capabilities of Group Policy and PowerShell in future scenarios.
