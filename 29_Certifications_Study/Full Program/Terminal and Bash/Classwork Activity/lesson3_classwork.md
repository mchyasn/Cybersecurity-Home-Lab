# Lesson 3

## Overview

In today's class, we learned about text processing and text editing in the terminal, and how to use them to develop a cd log_directory line script. We also learned about the benefits of text processing programs over programming languages for security professionals.

## What We Learned

- Three benefits of text processing programs over programming languages for a security professional.

- Use sed to make substitutions to a file.

- Use awk to isolate data points from a complex log file.

- Edit contents of a file using nano.

- Design an IP lookup shell script by passing arguments.

## Today's Activities

We completed the following activities in class:

- Warm-Up: We practiced using some of the terminal commands that we learned in previous classes.

- Using sed: We practiced using the text processing capability of sed to replace data and make data consistent.

- Using awk: We practiced using the awk command to isolate certain fields from complex files.

- My First Shell Script: We used shell scripts to assist with running several commands by running one single command.

- Building an IP Lookup Tool: We designed a script that can look up the country associated with an IP address in a log file. We used many of the terminal commands that we've learned this week to accomplish this task.

Overall, this was a great class that helped us develop our command-line skills and learn about text processing and editing in the terminal.
