# Classwork
## Overview
In Lesson 3 of Module 5, we focused on Linux log management and the importance of proper log management in ensuring network integrity. We learned how to manage log size, filter log messages, and audit logs using tools like journalctl, logrotate, and auditd.

## Key Takeaways

- Filtering cron and boot log messages using journalctl is essential for monitoring system events and diagnosing issues.
- Log size management using logrotate helps maintain system performance and avoid storage issues.
- Installing and configuring audit rules with auditd enables effective monitoring and auditing of system events.

## Today's Activities
Log Filtering: In this activity, we used journalctl to filter log files, allowing us to focus on specific events or narrow down our investigation.

Log Size Management: In this activity, we edited a logrotate configuration file and established a log rotation scheme based on a specific set of criteria, ensuring logs are maintained in a manageable size.

Event Monitor Log: In this activity, we used auditd to create an event monitoring system that generated alerts when new user accounts were created or modified, increasing our ability to detect suspicious activity.

## Reflection
Lesson 3 of Module 5 provided valuable insights into Linux log management and its significance in maintaining network integrity. Learning to filter log messages, manage log size, and audit logs using tools like journalctl, logrotate, and auditd expanded our Linux system administration skills. The activities offered practical experience in managing and analyzing log files, which is crucial for diagnosing issues and detecting security threats. Overall, this lesson was an important addition to our knowledge of Linux system administration and security.
