# Classwork
## Overview
In Lesson 2 of Module 5, we delved into using cron for scheduling and automating essential maintenance and security tasks. We learned how to create and manage cron jobs, write simple scripts for various tasks, and use cron to automate the execution of security scripts on a regular basis.

## Key Takeaways

- Scheduling regular jobs for individual users with crontab is an important aspect of system administration.
- Writing simple scripts for maintenance and security tasks streamlines processes and helps ensure system stability and security.
- Using cron to automate the execution of security scripts allows for consistent maintenance and monitoring.

## Today's Activities
Simple Cron Jobs: In this activity, we used cron to automate jobs, performing regularly scheduled backups of files containing personal identifiable information (PII) and personal health information (PHI).

Introduction to Scripts: In this activity, we wrote scripts that used cron to automate various tasks, such as performing regular backups and scheduling software updates to help keep the system secure.

Scheduling Backups and Cleanups: In this activity, we added previously written shell scripts to system-wide cron jobs, allowing the scripts to become automated with root privileges. We then set up regular security scans with Lynis.

Reviewing cron: In this activity, we reviewed everything we learned in this class, including cron, tar, and scripts.

## Reflection
Lesson 2 of Module 5 expanded our knowledge of Linux system administration by introducing cron for scheduling and automation. Learning to create and manage cron jobs, write scripts, and automate security tasks provided valuable hands-on experience in maintaining and securing Linux systems. The activities were engaging and helped reinforce the key concepts covered in class. Overall, this lesson built upon our existing Linux knowledge and provided crucial skills for ensuring system stability and security.
